What I had to do to access the data is put each NBA team into google trends, and since you can only do 5 items in trends at a time, I accessed it by NBA division (there are 5 teams per division). Each of those game me a .csv, and then I combined all 6 of the .csv files into one to have all the data in one place. Additionally, I removed some unnecessary data from the raw .csvs that i didnt really need as well as to make it more readable. \n",
